    "2. Overfitting can be prevented with a technique known as pruning, where you teach to ignore some paramters in the model to keep only the most important and get rid of some \"noise\", like in the ability to distinguish cats from dogs you may want the model to ignore the fur or tail and focus on the face and ears.\n",
